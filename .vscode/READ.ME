All users actions are made in views.py
I have two apps-Api and users,they use the same model Customuser
All forms are made in order to be used in views.py
For API I use rest.api
For Database I use POSTGRES which recieves users information
Now Users can add avatar,create profile,log in,log out,data is protected by Django functions and Database security.
